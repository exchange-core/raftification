/**
 * Invoked by leader to replicate log entries (5.3); also used as heartbeat (5.2).
 * <p>
 * TODO If desired, the protocol can be optimized to reduce the number of rejected AppendEntries RPCs. For example,
 * when rejecting an AppendEntries request, the follower can include the term of the conflicting entry and the first
 * index it stores for that term. With this information, the leader can decrement nextIndex to bypass all of the
 * conflicting entries in that term; one AppendEntries RPC will be required for each term with conflicting entries, rather
 * than one RPC per entry. In practice, we doubt this optimization is necessary, since failures happen infrequently
 * and it is unlikely that there will be many inconsistent entries.
